# Kalshi Market Analysis Automation

This repository contains a Python-based automation tool for analyzing and monitoring Kalshi market data. The tool fetches active market data, identifies popular markets based on trading volume, calculates Simple Moving Averages (SMA), and provides actionable alerts based on detected patterns.

## Features

- Fetches and processes active markets from Kalshi API.
- Identifies popular markets with high trading volumes.
- Calculates the 9-period Simple Moving Average (SMA9) to detect market patterns.
- Generates alerts for potential trading decisions based on SMA patterns.
- Monitors market prices in real-time.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tamzid2001/kalshi-market-analysis.git
    cd kalshi-market-analysis
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Configure your Kalshi API credentials in the `config` section of the code:
    ```python
    config = kalshi_python.Configuration()
    kalshi_api = kalshi_python.ApiInstance(
        email='your-email@example.com',
        password='your-password',
        configuration=config,
    )
    ```

## Usage

Run the main script to start the market analysis:
```bash
python kalshi.py
```

The script will:
- Fetch active markets from Kalshi API.
- Identify popular markets based on a predefined volume threshold.
- Monitor market prices, calculate SMA9, and detect patterns.
- Generate actionable alerts for potential trading decisions.

## Example

The following example demonstrates how the tool works:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
